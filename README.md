# Checkbox Enhancement

This extension is designed to enhance the functionality of the checkbox in markdown files. It is designed to work with the markdown preview and the markdown editor.

## Features

So far the main and only feature is a counter for the number of checked
checkboxes in the markdown file. This counter is displayed in the status bar.
You can change the format of the counter by clicking on it or executing the
`Checkbox Enhancement: Change Counter Format` command.

![checkbox-counter](lib/demo.mp4)

To show/hide the counter, you can use the `Checkbox Enhancement: Toggle Counter` command.

More features will be added in the future.
